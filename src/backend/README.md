# Running the Backend
The backend should always be run from main.py. Utility scripts can be run via command line arguments, use -h for details.

# CONFIGS
The backend files assume the existence of certain json config files. There are examples in the configs directory with the necessary fields dictated and whose names represent the necessary config files just with "example_" prepended.

# MIGRATIONS
The migrations directory contains a script to fill necessary tables in your database. It can be run with the -m argument on main.py
